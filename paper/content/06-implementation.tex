\section{Matrix implementation}

In this section, fundamental concepts related to matrix implementation are presented such as time complexity of various matrix operations,
matrix multiplication being as hard to compute as matrix inversion and others.
The objective is providing a sufficient understanding of key matrix operations.
The code presented will be in either pseudo-code or \SC{C++}.

\subsection{Matrix algorithms}

The following algorithms will be useful for the maximum matching algorithm: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Addition, subtraction and multiplication in matrices};
    \item \textbf{Matrix inversion};
    \item \textbf{Maximum rank of a matrix};
    \item \textbf{Rank-2 update of a matrix}.
\end{enumerate}

First, two theorems will be proven; They are useful for the computation of matrix inverse.

\begin{theorem}[Matrix multiplication is as hard as matrix inverse]
    If there is an algorithm that computes matrix multiplication in \(O(n^{\omega})\), then
    there is an algorithm that computes matrix inverse in \(O(n^{\omega})\).
\end{theorem}

There is an \textbf{maximum rank} of a matrix algorithm in \(O(n^{\omega})\).
