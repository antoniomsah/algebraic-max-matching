\section{Graph theory}

\begin{definition}[Graph]
	\label{def:graph}
	A \textbf{graph} \(G\) is a triple \((V, E, \varphi)\) such that
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item \(V\) is the \textbf{vertex set};
		\item \(E\) is the \textbf{edge set};
		\item \(\varphi: E \to V \times V\) is a relation between each edge and a pair of vertices, called the \textbf{incidence function} of \(G\).
	\end{enumerate}
	Usually, it is used 
	\(V(G)\) or \(V_G\) to denote \(V\) and 
	\(E(G)\) or \(E_G\) to denote \(E\).
	Also, if \(e \in E(G)\) and \(\varphi(e) = (u, v)\), then \(u\) and \(v\) are the \textbf{ends} of \(e\);
	When the context is clear, \((u, v)\) may be abbreviated to \(uv\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Matching]
	\label{def:matching}
	For a graph \(G \coloneqq (V, E, \varphi)\), a set \(M \subseteq E\) is a \textbf{matching} of \(G\) if and only if no two edges in \(M\) share an end.
	A vertex \(v \in V\) is \(M\)-covered if some edge of \(M\) incides in \(v\), 
	and it is said that \(M\) covers \(v\);
	Otherwise, \(v\) is \(M\)-exposed.
	A matching \(M\) is:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
			\textbf{maximal}, if there is no edge \(e \in E \setminus M\) such that \(M \cup \{e\}\) is a matching of \(G\);

		\item
			\textbf{maximum}, if for every matching \(M'\) of \(G\) one has \(|M| \geq |M'|\);
	
		\item
			\textbf{perfect}, if \(2|V_G| = |M|\), i.e., every vertex of \(G\) is covered.
	\end{itemize}
	Now, the following problem can be introduced.

\end{definition}
\begin{problem}{Maximum matching}
	Given a graph, find a maximum matching of this graph.
