\chapter{Conclusion}

In this paper, we implemented the randomized maximum matching algorithm introduced by \citet{Harvey:Paper}. 
The algorithm's approach leverages algebraic graph theory, contrasting with traditional methods like the Edmonds-Blossom algorithm \citet{Edmonds}. 
While Harvey's algorithm achieves a superior theoretical time complexity of $O(n^\omega)$ (where $n$ represents the number of vertices and $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication exponent), our implementation analysis in \cref{Harvey:analysis} and \cref{Maximum:analysis} reveals significant practical limitations. 
The high constant factor in the complexity makes the algorithm less efficient for smaller graphs. 
For competitive programming applications, where deterministic guarantees and practical performance on typical problem sizes are crucial, our results demonstrate that this theoretically elegant approach is outperformed by conventional methods. 
This implementation study highlights the important distinction between theoretical complexity improvements and practical algorithmic efficiency.

However, when considering the implementation aspects, Harvey's algorithm offers notable advantages. 
Setting aside the mathematical foundations behind the updates (e.g. \cref{update:1}), the algorithm provides a significantly more intuitive and straightforward implementation compared to the Edmonds-Blossom algorithm. 
This simplicity makes it particularly valuable for applications involving larger graphs or scenarios where absolute computational efficiency is not the primary concern.
